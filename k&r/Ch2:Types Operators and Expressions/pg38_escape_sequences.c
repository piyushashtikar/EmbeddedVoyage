printf("\n\n1. Sometimes abbreviated as FF, form feed is a button or command on the printer that allows the advancement of a printer page. This feature was frequently used on dot matrix printers since nearly all of them used continuous feed paper rather than single sheets. The form feed button was useful for advancing the ream of paper to the start of the next printing page, in the case of a paper jam, or when loading a new bundle of pin-feed paper.\n\n2. Form feed is also a special character that, when encountered in code, causes printers to automatically advance one full page or to the start of the next page. This form feed special character has a decimal value of 12 in the ASCII character set.");
